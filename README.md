# GraneetTest

## What is the use of this Repo

Set up an application composed of a front in React with an API
provided by a back in Node Js.
This application allows you to list the cities which correspond to an input character string.
The data should be retrieved from data.gouv.fr
(https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/codes-postaux/)
## Specs:
1. Only the first 100 cities should be displayed
2.  Cities should be divided into two categories, those of the metropolis and
others
3. Cities must be ordered by their names
4. The filtering of cities must be done in the back to avoid passing too much
of data
